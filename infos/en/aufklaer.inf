Enlightenment#
With the Age of Enlightenment rationalism will rise, and many 
religious virtues will dwindle to be replaced by
the new practicality. The Enlightenment will not 
be fruitful immediately, but it is the "point of departure"
for important processes like democracy or industrialization.
Research "Enlightenment" as soon as possible, or thou shalt be
ignorant forever.
