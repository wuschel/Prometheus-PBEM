Chemical Industry I #
Chemical Industry requires the basic ingredient crude oil. When you have a steady 
supply of oil and a shortage of ore/metal then we recommend to
specialize on this industrial branch.
After achieving the first level of Chemical Industry you will be able to
build better factories, which will produce 12 I instead of 10 I  
while requiring the same amount of ingredients.
