Chemical Industry V#
Upon reaching the fifth level everything can be rationalisized and 
simplified.
Instead of building new factories existing factories will be more efficient
and increase their output by 3 I each.
This applies to all sorts of chemical factories, e.g.
Distillation Furnaces, Refineries, Electrolysis Plants, Plastic Factories
and Pharmaceutical Industries.
