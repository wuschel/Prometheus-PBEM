Cyborg#
Ok,ok, we all know: Don´t bring up science fiction elements! But a Prometheus Cyborg is not a 
soulless robot. But he almost looks like one and is equipped with tons of hi-tech  
stuff. We implanted a miniatur OCTIUM 28000 in his chest which commands the cyborg to dodge 
whenever something evil is coming near. That´s why our beloved Cyborg 
boasts an amazing D-Bonus of 20 !
