Democracy#
In a modern democratical empire your towns only need 10 M
to operate a single square. Watch out though: Your units cannot execute
the commands OC and CP anymore, because such imperialistic 
actions are not tolerated by democracy-based Empires.#
To introduce Democracy you ought to have built a parliament 
in one of your towns and second AND researched the development "Democracy" 
successfully. Only then you can change your form of government by the ID 
command.
