Despotism#
Despotism is the most ancient form of 
government. The Ruler wields all power, a fact which casts a damper upon   
the population´s motivation. Therefore, each town requires
12 M for operating a square. (Remember the middle square is free!)
It seems reasonable to dismiss this form of government as soon as possible. Well,
you will lose your glorious title but we are sure that the advantages of a new form
of government will comfort you anyway.
