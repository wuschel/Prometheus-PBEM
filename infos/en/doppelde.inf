Biplane#
These are the first airplanes you can build. Planes have a lot of  
advantages. They are very fast, are not subject to territory restrictions,
and can only be attacked by other planes or by units equipped
with long-distance weapons. But beware, airplanes have only a 
limited range. Anyway, a very nifty thing is that your biplanes
can bombard squares. Just use the command BO 
and all units on that squares will suffer an attack with a total strength
of 10.
