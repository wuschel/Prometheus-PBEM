Jet Propulsion#
This common expression rather means the building of turbojet
engines, especially air-turbine turbojet engines according to the principle
of gas turbines, which are only operating at high velocities.
Anyway, (for all that technical stuff sucks) jet propulsion allows 
you to build Stealth Fighters which will certainly support your military superiority.
