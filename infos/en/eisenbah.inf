Railway #
A spectacular sight when your first "Iron Horse" slowly leaves 
your newly built Central Station. The Railway solves all problems of
transporting commodities. When you have built stations in all 
of your towns and connected the towns by roads
(those equal tracks) you can send your commodities to and from and back and 
forth and to and fro. However you want. With no extra charges.
