Iron Works#
Iron Works belong to the Heavy Industry sector. Iron Works do smelt
iron ores which are cast into melting pots and oddly-shaped castings moulds 
to eventually produce those fabulous Industrial Goods.
Each Iron Work produces 10 I each round whilst consuming
10 R and 10 E. Consider that production is only guaranteed if
you have sufficient supply of raw materials. Partial production
does not exist.
