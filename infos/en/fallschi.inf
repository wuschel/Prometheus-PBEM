Paratroopers#
When units are carried by your transport aircrafts, those can only
disembark at towns, Air Bases or Aircraft Carriers.
Paratroopers, though, can jump out of the aircraft whenever they want 
to. Use the command DE without giving a direction. You shouldn´t
jump while you are flying over the seas.#
Paratroopers have another advantage: They are (like the Pioneers)
able to construct roads or build structures (Air Bases), and they can 
carry up to 15 C.
