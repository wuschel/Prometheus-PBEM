Turret#
The Turrets sluggishly sneaks around cause it is one of the slowest units ever 
seen. But as soon it is dug in conventional weapons will hardly have
any chances. And what´s even more fiendish: It attacks with a firepower of
80! Thanks to its outstanding D-Bonus it is perfectly suited for supporting
weaker units or for building up a defensive line of units.
