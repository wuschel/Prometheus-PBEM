Fortress# 
A mighty fortress looms at the horizon and makes the enemies
tremble. You should build fortresses at important strategic points.
There, they add twice the D-boni of all defending units except when
facing long-distance weapons and bombardments. You cannot build
fortresses in your towns, if you need a better defense, try Walls or
Citadels instead.
