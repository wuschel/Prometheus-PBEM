Aircraft Carrier#
This giant battleship can supply and transport aircrafts of all sorts.
It is also, like towns or Air Bases, a base for aircrafts. 
To supply aircrafts it should have enough fuel in stock. (But 
any Carrier has sufficient capacity.) 

Additionaly it can transport other units, too.

Unfortunately the Carrier cannot fire and has only an average 
strength of 25 . Destroyers for escort seem to be a 
good idea.
