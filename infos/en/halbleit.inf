Semiconductor Factory#
From outside, it looks like a Lego Fortress. Inside, it looks like the
higest security deck in a Klingon spaceship. People clad in exotic
radiation suits huddle through various high-security zones, 
in sterile labs mysterious silicium discs gleam, windowless chambers -
loaded and wired up to the roof with Hi-Technology - house hideous hackers.
A semiconductor factory produces 30 I each round - while consuming 5 R, 5 C and 5 E .
