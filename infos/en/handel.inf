Trade#
As soon as your Empire knows the secret of Trade, you
can begin transporting commodities; e.g. you may pick up some stones 
there, bring them to a town, pick some wood, go back, et. al..
For all this you need appropriate transport units like caravans or vehicle convoys.
And you´d better be a Trade expert before your bulldozers churn away your forests;
unloading and loading goods requires Trade. (once again)
