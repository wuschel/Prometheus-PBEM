Woodworking#
As soon your as citizens are familiar with the skill of woodworking they 
may start building ships. A lot of other useful developments
require sufficient knowledge of woodworking.
Also, your dozers and gangs will gather wood when deforesting (command DF -Deforest) 
instead of simply burning those forests down.
