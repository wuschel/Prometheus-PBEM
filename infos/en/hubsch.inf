Helicopter#
A helicopter is a very special unit: It is the only airborne unit able
to load and unload other units without them having to be on a town
or air base square.
Equally, no base is needed for transshipping commodities. 
Helicopter are ingenious units for tactical manoeuvers, but they should 
refrain from entering aerial combats or other..
