Infantery#
A very well renowned unit thanks to its impressive performance in some minor
civil wars. Each regiment consists of 15.000  mighty men; so better be careful that you 
do not complety suck away all your precious town´s population.
Of course, 15.000 soldiers demand a stellar upkeep;
but in exchange you get a very agile and universal military unit gifted with a 
comfortable D-Bonus.
