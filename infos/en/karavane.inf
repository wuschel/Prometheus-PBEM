The sole purpose of caravans is to transport commodities like wood, food, 
stone and ore from one town to another , or from a mine to a town and 
vice versa. By using the commands LO (Load) and
 UL (Unload) commodies will be loaded and ..... unloaded !
Also, when compared to other units, caravans are quite speedy.
Therefore, you could use them as a cheap scouting unit in the early game.
