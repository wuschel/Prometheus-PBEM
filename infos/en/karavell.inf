Caravel#
Do you remember that guy called Columbus? Yeah, exactly, he discovered
America. But do you remember with which kind of ships he sailed the seas? No, you didn´t 
pay attention at school. Anyway, we are here to tell you: A fleet of Caravels he used.
And you, too, can be soon a proud owner of such a prestigious and proud 
vessel !
Overall, the Caravel is light and agile ship. She is not suited for menial work
like transporting commodities and/or units. No, such lowly 
tasks are better performed by those ugly Cogs.
