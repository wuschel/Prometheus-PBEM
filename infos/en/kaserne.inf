Barracks#
Of course you won´t need barracks to gather a smelly bunch of peasants 
armed with rusty pitchforks and threshing flails. Maybe this horde will even win
a fight against some rabid hedgehogs. But you´ll surely need to
build some barracks if you strife for a solid military force. It´ll make
all negotiations way easier...hehe. In short : No barracks, no army.
