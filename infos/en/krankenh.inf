Hospital#
For the first time in history the sick ones will not be put into 
quarantaine or into putrid leper camps. New medicinal skills and  
compassionate healers will cure, heal and ressurect (for 800 Gold).
A hospital will cover 100.000 happy citizens.
Therefore, each hospital adds 10.000 strong and smart people to  
your townsfolk.. But still overall citizen growth each turn cannot exceed 10%.
