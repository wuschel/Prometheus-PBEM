Mechanical Engineering requires an equal proportion of crude oil and 
ore to produce valuable Industrial Goods while consuming fewer energy
than e.g. Heavy Industry or Chemical Industry..
If you have a steady and balance supply of R and C you might well
specialize in Mechanical Engineering. The first level allows you 
to construct more productive factories which produce 12 I
instead of 10 I each turn.
