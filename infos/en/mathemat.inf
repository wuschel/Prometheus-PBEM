As everybody knows, rational
technical progress is impossible without funded mathematical knowledge.
Well, in the beginning, it may have had only a slight impact or none at all 
(except annoyed pupils bemoaning their bad grades).#
But later on, in conjunction with the invention of the Wheel, you can research 
Mechanics - which in return is required to build evil Catapults.
