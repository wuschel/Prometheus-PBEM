Mechanoid#
The Mechanoid doesn´t care whether his treads along highway or travels
through murky swamps or dense forests; it always has a movement
cost of merely 4. See, wheels are better than feet. It shuns water because
it is afraid of creeping corrosion. 
A Mech`  can construct roads ( 20 rounds) or build structures (1 turn) like a 
lame bulldozer or Worker Gang, but it is heavily armed and armored.
