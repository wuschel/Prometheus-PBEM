Musketeers#
Who does not remember Artos, Portos and Aramis, the famous musketeers,
who saved together with D'Artagnan the french Queen ??#
Whether your musketeers will become that famous depends on your 
skills. Anyway, due to their strength they are certainly a useful
military unit for a skillful Emperor.
