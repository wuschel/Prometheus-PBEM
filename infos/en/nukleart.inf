Nuclear Element Transporter #
You can´t throw your nuclear fuel elements onto a creaking cart and
transport them into the next town. Someone told you that those
elements are a bit dangerous and require special containers. 
Also you need a special transporter vehicle and hordes of cops to protect
your valuable transporters from environmentalist and ecologist mob.
