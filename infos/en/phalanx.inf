Phalanx#
In contrast to Volunteer Forces the military trained and well-versed
Phalanges master the famous and fabulous turtle formation
technique which blesses them with a defense bonus of 3. A 
solid unit to guard your towns. To increase their effectiveness, dig in
more phalanges at adjacent squares so they can support and add their
defense boni to the original defending unit.
