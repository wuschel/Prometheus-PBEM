Let´s be honest: The problem of those impracticable forms of territories
is not solved yet. Sure, flying is cool, but who does all the menial 
tasks on ground ? And how does one supply those voracious
external structures? Hmm, we think you need units with legs (or other pseudopods),
preferrably some jangling robots suited for construction AND battle.
