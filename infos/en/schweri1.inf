Heavy Industry I#
Heavy Industry is an industrial branch dealing with smelting and processing
of ores. This means (in our wonderful game) that the production of Industrial 
Goods requires -besides energy- ore only. Upon gaining level one, you
will be able to build more modern plants which, in turn, produce more goods 
while consuming fewer raw materials.
