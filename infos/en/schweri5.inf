Heavy Industry  V#
Hey, don´t panic! Level five doesn´t mean : New factories & Modernization &
Investitions & Extra costs & Coffer-draining construction sites.
Nooooo, much better. On achieving level five, all your Iron Works,
Blast-Furnaces, Foundries, Roll Works and Aluminium Works will produce
(if they do produce at all) an additional 3 I each turn. 
Why ? New technologies. 
Which technologies? Don´t ask and annoy, reap the rewards !
