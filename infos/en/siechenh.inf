Sick-House#
Sick-Houses provide for a (partially) advanced medicinal coverage of all your 
ailing citizens. Still, none of your citzens will be healed or even resurrected,
but your sanctum custodians will prevent the spreading of filthy epidemics. 
Each sick-house covers 25.000 inhabitants and provides for a 10% citizen growth each 
turn. Overall citizens growth cannot exceed 10% though.
