Settlers#
Settlers are a higly specialized unit. Like housewives, settlers
cannot fight, defend, transport, construct and move extremly
sluggishly. Though, (and unlike housewives), without Settlers
you won´t win the game, because only the famous Settlers can found
new thriving cities. (Command FC+Name , e.g FCNiedergallmig )
Whenever a town levies Settlers, 15.000 happy people will be deducted
from your town´s population; so be careful not to completely drain
your town....
