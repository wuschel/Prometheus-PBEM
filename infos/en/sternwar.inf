Observatory#
An Observatory (you only need a single one) is your only chance to observe
those falling stars/satellites/space shuttles/ meteorites. Additionally, 
they will locate positions of nuclear weapon impacts.
Unfortunately, due to all the smog in big cities, Observatories
can only be built in the countryside (BUOB).
