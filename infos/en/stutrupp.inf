Sturmtruppen (Stormtroopers)#
Sturmtruppen are basically upgraded Infanteries wielding ultra-modern German
weaponery and thus being even more lethal. Sturmtruppen are a formation of
25.000 (!) hardened teutonic slayers, so be careful when levying them (in respect
to your town´s population). DEINE FEINDE WERDEN ERZITTERN! JAWOLL!
