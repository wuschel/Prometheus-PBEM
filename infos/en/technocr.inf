Technocracy#
Technocracy is a form of government deriving from a democratical state which
has achieved a high level of technology. For industrious researchers
Technocracy is much more effective than a Democracy because of
the additional research bonus of 20 M for each of your towns.
Unfortunately, bellicose unit commands like AT,CQ,CP,FI and BO
are strictly forbidden. The price of progress...
To introduce Technocracy, you must have researched "Technocracy"
and already have introduced Democracy..
