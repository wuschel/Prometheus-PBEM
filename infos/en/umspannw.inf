Transformer Station#
In general, it is impossible to store and save electricity.
But in those modern industrial times you won´t like to see all that
valuable energy fizzle, so command your technicians to work on 
Transformer Stations. Don´t ask what exactly happens in those stations,
just note that each Station will store 10 E until the beginning of 
your next turn.
