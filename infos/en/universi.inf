University#
On building the very first University a town can honestly be called
"Center of Knowledge". From everywhere, confused professors and
diligent (?) students are attracted to conserve and enhance knowledge.
This is reflected by a 15 M research bonus for every University each turn;
deduct the 4 M upkeep and you will still have a nice net M-bonus of 11.
