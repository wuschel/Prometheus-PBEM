Uranium Mine#
A mine which does not haul ore but nuclear fuel elements.
Basically the same as an ordinary mine with a little difference:
When built, automatic delivery will be OFF! Cause uranium is 
a No-No for children and would-be Emperors, it will be kept in your 
mine until you specify otherwise. (Command DO)
Just remember to build an Uranium Depot in your town, (best BEFORE
delivery) or all your nuclear hot stuff will be wasted.
