Experimental Reactor#
Always the fuss about that annyoing nuclear energy!
Without an Experimental Reactor (which sounds quite dangerous
and irreliable, but don´t panic) you will never discover Reactor
Technology and without that technology you´ll never have access
to all those hyper-lethal nuclear stuff. Moreover, such a Reactor adds 10 M
to your town´s research bonus each turn.
