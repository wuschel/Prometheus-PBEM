Viking Ship#
Contrary to the poor slaves on a Galley, the mates on a Viking Ship 
row voluntarily. And they engange in combat voluntarily, glorifying
death on the battlefield, dreaming of joining the ranks of fallen warriors in
Valhalla. That´s why a Viking Ship is tougher to defeat than other vessels.
Still, she cannot transport units, but who cares anyway...
