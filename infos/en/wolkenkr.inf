Skyscraper#
If you ever manage to collect all the stuff to erect such an monstrosity...
Congratulations ! Enter one of the 63 elevators to speed through 158 levels
(including the subterrean shopping malls and torture chambers and some
posh "scenic vista" restaurants on top of the whole thing), visit all of those
2000-odd offices and shake 666.666 bossy hands. Besides of that, every Skyscraper
generates an amazing 100 M bonus each turn, which can be used for anything but
operating squares.
