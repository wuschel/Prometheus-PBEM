Citadel#
You already have City Walls ? You still think your towns need more
protection ? You have been piling up tons of stones ? 
We recommend a Citadel....
It adds to all defending units their D-Bonus once more. Remember, units on a town
square add their D- Bonus once; with a City Wall twice, with a Citadel the bonus
is quadrupled. A unit dug in has its bonus even QUINTUPLED!
Still, this will not protect your poor inhabitants (and units) against nasty 
missile attacks and bombardments.
